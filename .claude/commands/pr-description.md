# Create a PR description

Check the diff against main, and produce a PR title and description.

The title should be a concise, product-focused description of what changed.

The PR description should be produced in Markdown. Here's some high-level guidance on a good
description:

- Put a high-level 1-3 sentence summary at the top, followed by a more detailed breakdown of the
  changes.
- Aim for brevity and avoid verbose descriptions of things that are manifestly clear from code.
- The description should focus on the "what", and less on the "how", with an emphasis on product and
  architectural changes
- If there are descriptive commit messages, reference them as a guide for what should be included in
  the description
